                        develops a proteiform practice that finds its origin

                        collaborations. In the center of these exchanges is the question of
                        the transmission and survival of knowledge, both as well subjective
                        as anecdotal and memorable.

                        is the alias of Spanish designer and visual artist Pablo Iglesias (Madrid, 1977), currently
                        based in Berlin. His work is mostly connected / crafted around music projects, offering a visual
                        response to sound either as live visuals, art installations, music videos or cover artworks.
                        Besides the influence of music and sound as a source, he usually digs in different concepts such
                        as the perception of light and its physicality, the paradoxes defining our knowledge of reality,
                        freedom and self-being, or the perfection within errors and glitches, to name a few.
